				Just imagine if we could walk together toward a world without
				suicide. Since 2002, the American Foundation for Suicide
				Prevention’s Out of the Darkness Walks have brought friends,
				neighbors, family members and colleagues together to walk
				through their communities to raise public awareness and funds to
				support suicide prevention, including education programs in
				local schools and workplaces; support for those who’ve lost
				loved ones; advocacy for critical mental health and suicide
				prevention legislation; and scientific research that helps us
				learn more how we can save more lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				September is National Suicide Prevention Month, and we want you
				to join us as we make strides in saving lives, and bringing
				hope, one step at a time, to those affected by suicide.
			</p>
			<p>Together, let’s walk.</p>
